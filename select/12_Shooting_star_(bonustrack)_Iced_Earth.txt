Johnny Was A Schoolboy
When He Heard His First Beatles Song
Love Me Do I Think It Was
And From There It Didn't Take Him Long
Got Himself A Guitar
Used To Play Every Night
Now He's In A Rock And Roll Outfit
And Everything's All Right
Don't Ya Know
Johnny Told His Mama
Hey, Mama, I'm Going Away
I'm Gonna Hit The Big Time
Gonna Be A Big Star Someday
Momma Came To The Door
With A Teardrop In Her Eye
Johnny Said Don't Cry Momma,
Smile And Wave Goodbye.
Don't You Know
Don't You Know
That You Are A Shooting Star,.(Don't You Know, Don't You Know)
Don't You Know That You Are
A Shooting Star
And All The World Will Love You
Just As Long.As Long As You Are?
Johnny Made A Record
Went Straight Up To Number One
Suddenly Everyone Loved To Hear Him Sing His Song
Watching The World Go By
Surprising It Goes So Fast
Johnny Looked Around Him
And Said Well I Made The Big Time At Last.
A Shooting Star.,...
Johnny Died One Night
Died In His Bed
Bottle Of Whiskey, Sleeping Tablets
By His Head
Johnny's Life Passed Him
By Like A Warm Summer Day
If You Listen To The Wind
You Can Still Hear Him Play
Don't You Know,...
(Improv Of Chorus)
