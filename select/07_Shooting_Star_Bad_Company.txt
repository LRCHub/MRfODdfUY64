Johnny was a schoolboy
When he heard his first Beatles song
"Love Me Do", I think it was
And from there, it didn't take him long
Got himself a guitar
Used to play every night
Now he's in a rock and roll outfit
And everything's all right
Don't ya know
Johnny told his mama
Hey, mama, I'm going away
I'm gonna hit the big time
Gonna be a big star someday
Mama came to the door
With a teardrop in her eye
Johnny said, "don't cry, mama"
"Smile and wave goodbye"
Don't you know (yeah, yeah)
Don't you know
That you are a shooting star
Don't you know, don't you know
Don't you know that you are
A shooting star
And all the world will love you
Just as long, as long as you are
Johnny made a record
Went straight up to number one
Suddenly everyone loved to hear him sing his song
Watching the world go by
Surprising it goes so fast
Johnny looked around him and said
"Well, I made the big time at last"
Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know
That you are a shooting star
Don't you know, whoa, yeah
Don't you know that you are
A shooting star, yeah
And all the world will love you
Just as long, as long as you are
A shooting star
Don't you know
That you are a shooting star
Don't you know, ooh
Don't you know that you are
A shooting star
And all the world will love you
Just as long, as long as you are
Johnny died one night
Died in his bed
Bottle of whiskey, sleeping tablets
By his head
Johnny's life passed him by
Like a warm summer day
If you listen to the wind
You can still hear him play
Ooh
Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you know, don't you know
Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you know
Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you know, don't you
Know, oh, that you are
A shooting star, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, woo
Don't you, don't you know
That you are a shooting star
Don't you, don't you know
