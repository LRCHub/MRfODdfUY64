No one noticed you had disappeared
Its been two days no connection
Pile of hardware making hits
If the quality is high
At the party there's a place for you
On the guest list there's a place for you
In a somebody's arms

In the real world, its at your front door
Wanting everything and moving places
Worn to make the mind crash
Snaping into Making sense
Being off schedule with the world

In the cosmopolitan we see jeff koons
Celebrating yummy things, celebrating,
And talking of his... of his suffering

Break through programfor senior executives guide to slow dance Tokyo
Unhealthy rise and danger, INB BSE chief impact
Officers, who's helping? fear of regional digital divide,
Its mount fuji sitting above the clouds
Searching for consensus
Master bites the bullet
How clearly do you need?
Your customers company economy going public
We have both

Chorus:
It won't work
It doesn't make sense
It can't be done
Do it this way
No that way, stop!
It can't be done
Do it this way!
Do it this way!

It won't work
It doesn't make sense
It can't be done
Do it this way
No that way, stop
Imagine a different way
Do it this way

Tickets unused, toys of the mind
We think improvement, a better feeling
Generated, accelerating
That was a strange movie you took me through

He's a finder of strange things
Random, cardboard box
In the closet, left untouched
For a future functions
When the animal comes out
Voice of terror
Screaming at you
Screaming at you
What you think is real

Nation in the grip of phone fever
Three, the big three
Shooting from the hip
This is no way to pick a president
Shooting from the hip
Cover feature, divided world
Shooting from the hip
Star bright, survival of the fittest
Shooting from the hip
Open market economy, Microsoft 8
Shooting from the hip
Deal in human rights, lost connection

Chorus
