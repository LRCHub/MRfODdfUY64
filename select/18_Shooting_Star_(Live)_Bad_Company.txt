Well Johnny was a schoolboy
When he heard his first Beatles song
'Love Me Do' I think it was
From then it didn't take him long

Got himself a guitar
Used to play every night
Now he's in a rock 'n' roll outfit
And everything's alright

Don't you know? Don't you know?

Johnny told his Mama
"Hey, Mama, I'm goin' away
I'm gonna hit the big time
Gonna be a big star someday"

Mama came to the door
With a teardrop in her eye
Johnny said, "Don't cry Mama
Smile and wave goodbye"

Don't you know?
Everybody, wave!
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
Goodbye baby, yeah
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
And all the world will love you just as long
Long as you are

Well, Johnny made a record
Went straight up to number one
Suddenly everyone loved
To hear him sing the song

Watchin' the world go by
Surprisin' it goes so fast
Johnny looked around him and said, "Hey
I made the big-time, I made the big-time at last, yeah!"

Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
Shining on forever, somewhere with me
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
All the world will love you just as long
Long as you are
Hey

Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
Shining on
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
All the world will love you just as long
Long as you are

Now easy now
Well, well, well, well
Well, well
Well my friends, my story is near the end and I
I'm gonna sing the song
But I want you to sing along

I'm gonna sing the song
But I want you to sing along
Are you ready now?
Are you ready now?
That's good

Well Johnny died one night, died in his bed
A bottle of whiskey, sleeping tablets by his head
Johnny's life passed him by like a warm summer day
If you listen to the wind you can still hear him play

Don't you know? Don't you know? (Come on Wembley)
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
Don't you know? (I know)
Don't you know? (I know)
Don't you know that you are a shooting star? (Oh yeah, yeah)
Don't you know? (You got it)
Don't you know? (Let's do it again, come on)

Don't you know that you are a shooting star? (Oh yeah)
Don't you know? (Feels good)
Don't you know? (Big one)
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
Don't you know? (Oh, yeah)

Play that with your heart and soul
Can't hear it, boy
Have mercy, baby

Mercy on me, babe
I like it
Can we hear it one more time?
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Baby, baby, baby...

I just want to sing it one more time now

Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
Gotta shine on now, forever now
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
All the world will love you just as long
Long as you are
A shooting star

Oh yeah
Give yourselves a round of applause
Yeah
