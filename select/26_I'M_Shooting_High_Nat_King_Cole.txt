I'm shooting high
Got my eye on a star in the sky
Shooting high
I'll never stop till I get to the top
Tell me why shouldn't I?

You know it's you I'm after
You're my lucky star
I'm on a rainbow rafter
Climbing up to where you are

I'll have a time
It's a climb but I'll make it
'Cause I'm shooting high

Shooting high
I'll never stop till I get to the top
Tell me why shouldn't I?

You know it's you I'm after
You're my lucky star
I'm on a rainbow rafter
Climbing up to where you are

I'll have a time
It's a climb but I'll make it
'Cause I'm shooting high
Shooting high, shooting high
