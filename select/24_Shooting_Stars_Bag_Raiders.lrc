[00:41.37] It's late and I'm awake
[00:45.16] Staring at the wall
[00:49.07] Open up my window
[00:53.17] Head floats out the door
[00:56.73] No one else around
[01:00.40] The shimmer takes my eye
[01:05.23] I lift my head
[01:08.40] Blinded by the sky
[01:17.40] 
[01:12.32] Feel my weight in front
[01:16.13] Following the sound
[01:19.84] Moves away so fast
[01:23.64] Fall down to the ground
[01:27.71] I know there's more to come
[01:31.36] Jump back to my feet
[01:34.88] Now I only see ahead of me
[01:39.06] Chasing down the street
[01:50.56] 
[02:43.09] Gave my love to a shooting star
[02:45.77] But she moves so fast
[02:47.55] That I can't keep up
[02:49.58] I'm chasing
[02:50.64] I'm in love with a shooting star
[02:53.12] But she moves so fast
[02:55.12] When she falls then
[02:56.78] I'll be waiting
[02:58.27] Gave my love to a shooting star
[03:00.94] But she moves so fast
[03:02.86] That I can't keep up
[03:04.85] I'm chasing
[03:06.04] I'm in love with a shooting star
[03:08.60] But she moves so fast
[03:10.46] When she falls then
[03:12.21] I'll be waiting
[03:19.71] 
[03:13.77] Gave my love to a shooting star
[03:16.33] But she moves so fast
[03:18.28] That I can't keep up
[03:20.01] I'm chasing
[03:21.24] I'm in love with a shooting star
[03:23.92] But she moves so fast
[03:25.91] When she falls then
[03:27.56] I'll be waiting
