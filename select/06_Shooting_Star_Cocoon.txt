The wind has turned, it happened so quickly
It just took a year or two
Long forgotten, all the good you've done
All the good you still could do
To get back on track just don't look back
Don't you be ashamed, drunk and afraid
It's over now, time to let go
Wish upon a shooting star
Burning down the neon sky
Sell the shiny German car
And kiss your golden ass goodbye
"A one-hit-wonder" say the newspapers
Here's a toast to you
Now do yourself a favor and don't give a fuck
You got nothing to prove
Your place has been taken, you won't be a legend
Just another example of a chain reaction
It's over now, time to let go
