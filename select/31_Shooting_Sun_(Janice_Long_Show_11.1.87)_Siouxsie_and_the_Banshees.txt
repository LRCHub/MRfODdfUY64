We've been waiting, inside our fears
Eyes that scorn you, imprison you with tears
Now awoken, rise up your new age schemes
Like the shooting sun, mirrors your golden dreams
We'll wait for you 'til dawn - it's ringing in
To stare back at the eyes that scorn

We've been sinking, with every step they spurn
Now we're thinking, it's time for them to burn
Crept up slowly, with a pocket full of beams
Softly spoken, "Take these eyes and see"
And we'll curse the years of stone
We'll laugh in the eyes that scorn - ringing in

We'll light them one by one, touched by the shooting sun
Flames run in golden streams, echoing golden dreams
We'll kiss them one by one, just like the shooting sun
We'll burst the years of stone,
We'll laugh in the eyes that scorn - ring it in

(Fading)

We'll burst the years of stone,
We'll laugh in the eyes that scorn - ring it in

We'll light them one by one,
We'll burst the years of stone - touched by the shooting sun
We'll laugh in the eyes that scorn
We'll kiss them one by one
We'll burst the years of stone - like my shooting sun
We'll laugh in the eyes that scorn - my shooting sun
